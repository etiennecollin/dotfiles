#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      JetBrainsMono Nerd Font
bold_font        auto
italic_font      auto
bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: +list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. When bold_font or bold_italic_font is set to
#: auto on macOS, the priority of bold fonts is semi-bold, bold,
#: heavy. Setting them manually is useful for font families that have
#: many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

font_size 12.0

#: Font size (in pts)

enabled_layouts splits

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the layouts <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts>.

allow_remote_control yes

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on, other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc. Note that this even works over SSH
#: connections. The default setting of no prevents any form of remote
#: control. The meaning of the various values are:

#: password
#:    Remote control requests received over both the TTY device and the socket are
#:    confirmed based on passwords, see remote_control_password.

#: socket-only
#:    Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted unconditionally.
#:    Requests received over the TTY are denied. See listen_on.

#: socket
#:    Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted unconditionally.
#:    Requests received over the TTY are confirmed based on password.

#: no
#:    Remote control is completely disabled.

#: yes
#:    Remote control requests are always accepted.

listen_on unix:@mykitty

#: Listen to the specified UNIX socket for remote control connections.
#: Note that this will apply to all kitty instances. It can be
#: overridden by the kitty --listen-on command line option, which also
#: supports listening on a TCP socket. This option accepts only UNIX
#: sockets, such as unix:${TEMP}/mykitty or unix:@mykitty (on Linux).
#: Environment variables are expanded and relative paths are resolved
#: with respect to the temporary directory. If {kitty_pid} is present,
#: then it is replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the
#: PID of the kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen.
#: See the help for kitty --listen-on for more details. Note that this
#: will be ignored unless allow_remote_control is set to either: yes,
#: socket or socket-only. Changing this option by reloading the config
#: is not supported.
